# Try Attestor First

Use this when you want the shortest local run before reading the deeper architecture docs.

```bash
npm install
npm run example:admission
```

The demo shows two AI-assisted finance consequences:

- one is admitted and allowed to proceed
- one is blocked fail-closed before the downstream action happens

In both cases, the shape is the same:

```text
proposed consequence -> Attestor admission decision -> proof refs -> downstream gate
```

## What You Should See

The output is grouped into four practical parts:

- **Input:** what the customer system wants to write, send, file, or execute
- **Attestor decision:** the native result and canonical admit / narrow / review / block decision
- **Proof refs:** the portable evidence references returned with the decision
- **Downstream result:** whether the customer system proceeds or holds

This is the simplest way to see Attestor's role: proof first, action second.

To see the stronger customer-side shape after that, run:

```bash
npm run example:non-bypassable-gateway
```

That demo shows a payment adapter whose dispatch function is only reachable after the verifier helper allows the Attestor admission.

## What This Does Not Claim

- It is not the generic hosted `POST /api/v1/admissions` route.
- It is not a public hosted crypto route.
- It is not a wallet, custody platform, agent runtime, or orchestration layer.
- It does not auto-detect packs from payload shape.

Customer systems still choose the relevant Attestor surface explicitly.
