# Attestor

AI can propose actions.

Attestor makes sure those actions do not become real without policy, authority, and evidence.

It sits between AI-assisted systems and real-world consequences, then blocks, narrows, reviews, or admits critical actions before downstream systems write, send, file, or execute.

Attestor does not replace your system. It sits in front of it, controlling what is allowed to become real.

## Why it matters

An AI agent, automation, or workflow may try to:

- write a controlled financial record
- send customer-facing output
- approve a high-risk business action
- trigger programmable-money execution

Without a control point, the action may rely on informal trust. When routed through Attestor, every proposed consequence is checked, policy is enforced, proof material is produced for allowed paths, and unsafe actions fail closed.

## Example

An AI-assisted workflow tries to approve a high-risk financial action.

Attestor intercepts before the downstream system acts:

- policy requires stronger approval
- required authority or evidence is missing

Result:

- `block`
- downstream does not proceed
- the path fails closed instead of becoming a real action

When policy, authority, and evidence pass, Attestor can return `admit` with proof references for later review.

## Decisions

Attestor always returns one of four bounded outcomes:

- `admit` - allow the action
- `narrow` - allow only a safer bounded version
- `review` - require human or external review
- `block` - reject fail-closed

## What you can do with Attestor

- Prevent AI-assisted systems from sending unauthorized payments.
- Control AI-generated financial records before release.
- Gate programmable-money actions before execution.
- Add policy enforcement to automation systems.
- Require human approval for high-risk actions.

For the longer use-case map, see [What you can do with Attestor](docs/01-overview/what-you-can-do.md).

## Try it in 60 seconds

```bash
npm install
npm run example:admission
```

What you'll see:

- one path is admitted with proof references
- one path is blocked fail-closed
- the downstream gate only proceeds when the decision allows it

## How Attestor works in practice

- A customer system proposes a sensitive output, record, action, or programmable-money move.
- It calls Attestor before the downstream system writes, sends, files, or executes that consequence.
- Attestor evaluates active policy, required authority, and evidence requirements.
- Attestor returns a bounded decision: admit, narrow, review, or block, plus proof material.
- The downstream system proceeds only when the decision allows it and otherwise fails closed.
- The result can be reviewed and independently verified later.

For the canonical customer-facing operating model and decision vocabulary, see [Attestor operating model](docs/01-overview/operating-model.md).

## One product, modular packs

Attestor is one product, not a collection of unrelated products.

One product. One platform core. Hosted and customer-operated delivery paths. Modular packs for finance, crypto, and later consequence domains.

The same platform core stays in place across domains: release decisions, policy activation, enforcement verification, and portable authorization objects. Finance and crypto sit on top of that shared core as modular packs.

- **Finance pack:** the strongest proof wedge today
- **Crypto pack:** the programmable-money extension on the same policy / authority / proof / fail-closed model
- **Later packs:** additional consequence domains can attach to the same core without becoming separate primary products by default

Attestor does not magically guess what to run. Customer systems call the relevant Attestor path for the consequence they want to control.

## Current proof wedge

The deepest proven wedge today is finance.

The first hard boundary is:

**AI output -> structured financial record release**

That is where weak acceptance models break quickly: reviewer authority matters, deterministic checks matter, portable proof matters, and auditability is not optional.

Finance is the current proving ground, not the ceiling of the platform.

See [AI-assisted financial reporting acceptance](docs/01-overview/financial-reporting-acceptance.md).

## How teams adopt Attestor

Teams buy a control layer, not a replacement for their existing systems.

Attestor is called from the customer's own environment. Customer data, business workflows, models, agents, wallets, and operational systems stay where they already are.

Teams are buying governed release and authorization infrastructure, portable proof, independent verification, and a bounded control point before consequence.

A practical buying path is simple:

- Evaluation starts on the free `community` path or locally from this repo.
- If the hosted path fits, teams sign up, receive the first API key, and upgrade through Stripe when moving onto a paid hosted plan.
- If stricter runtime or isolation is required, production moves through the enterprise customer-operated path.

In both paths, Attestor stays in front of an existing system that would otherwise write, send, file, or execute the consequence directly.

Paid hosted starts at `starter`; customer-operated production fits the enterprise path. Production use is commercial under BSL 1.1 until the Change Date in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Platform core

| Core layer | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Release layer | consequence decisions, deterministic checks, tokens, reviewer queue, evidence packs | complete, packaged |
| Policy control plane | signed policy bundles, activation, rollback, scoping, simulation, audit trail | complete, packaged |
| Enforcement plane | offline/online verification, gateways, DPoP, mTLS/SPIFFE, HTTP message signatures | complete, packaged |
| Crypto authorization core | programmable-money authorization vocabulary, bindings, simulation, adapter preflight | complete, packaged |

## Pack status

| Pack | What it means today | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Finance | deepest proven path today; financial reporting is the current proving wedge | mature proving pack |
| Crypto | real programmable-money core on the same model, with packaged admission surfaces for external integrations | `attestor/crypto-authorization-core` complete, packaged; `attestor/crypto-execution-admission` complete, packaged |

The crypto pack already covers the authorization core and execution-admission surfaces, including wallet RPC, Safe guard, ERC-4337 bundler, modular-account runtime, delegated-EOA runtime, x402 resource-server middleware, custody policy callback paths, intent-solver handoffs, uniform admission telemetry / signed receipts, JSON conformance fixtures, and a curated package surface for external integrators. It extends the same Attestor control model; it is not a separate product identity.

## Proof and verification

Attestor does not stop at policy text. It produces portable proof material and supports independent verification.

To inspect the shared finance/crypto proof surface locally:

```bash
npm run proof:surface
```

That command writes `.attestor/proof-surface/latest/` with a manifest, machine-readable bundle, markdown summary, and one unified proof output per runnable scenario. It is a local static proof surface; it does not start a hosted console or claim a public hosted crypto route.

Shortest proof path:

```bash
npm run showcase:proof
npm run verify:cert -- .attestor/showcase/latest/evidence/kit.json
```

That path generates a local PostgreSQL-backed proof packet, then verifies the resulting kit outside the main runtime. Without a live upstream model, `verify:cert` reports `PROOF_DEGRADED` and exits non-zero by design; the full local release gate remains `npm run verify`.

For tagged evaluation releases, the separate [Release Provenance workflow](.github/workflows/release-provenance.yml) packages the review artifacts and publishes a GitHub artifact attestation for the resulting `evaluation-artifacts.tar.gz` bundle. Scope and non-claims are in [Artifact attestation plan](docs/08-deployment/artifact-attestation-plan.md).

## Quick start

## What Attestor is not

- Not the model
- Not the agent runtime
- Not the downstream system that actually writes, sends, files, executes, or settles
- Not a wallet or custody platform
- Not an orchestration framework or generic AI workspace
- Not a magical system that guesses the right path automatically
- Not proof that AI or programmable execution is inherently trustworthy
