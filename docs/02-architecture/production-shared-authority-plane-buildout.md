# Production Shared Authority Plane Buildout Tracker

This tracker covers the next Attestor runtime frontier after the completed production-runtime hardening track: turning the `production-shared` profile into a real multi-node authority plane with shared authoritative release and policy state.

The goal is not to add a new product, a new crypto branch, or a new public API surface. The goal is to finish the runtime cut line honestly: one Attestor platform core, one shared authority plane, and explicit fail-closed truth about what can and cannot be claimed in production.

## Guardrails For This Tracker

- The numbered step list below is frozen for this buildout track.
- Step ids and titles do not get rewritten or renumbered later.
- We may append clarifying notes, acceptance criteria, or sub-notes.
- We may only change the `Status`, `Evidence`, and `Notes` columns as work progresses.
- Keep Attestor as one product with one platform core and modular packs.
- Do not add a new hosted crypto route as part of shared-runtime work.
- Do not widen the public product story from runtime internals.
- Keep `production-shared` scoped to the repository-tested shared authority plane plus promotion gates; do not imply that an external customer-operated environment is ready until render/probe packets and rehearsal pass.
- Use PostgreSQL-backed shared state for authoritative release and policy records; do not promote Redis into the sole authority record for release or policy truth.
- Keep Redis in its existing coordination roles where it already fits: async execution, queueing, rate-limit windows, and other shared runtime coordination that is not the durable authority record.
- Carry the audit gaps forward on every remaining step: pack completion is not the same as multi-node runtime readiness, shared stores are not runtime-ready until bootstrap wiring proves them, and every authority mutation must preserve fail-closed behavior under concurrency and restart.

## Why This Track Exists

Attestor's major platform tracks are now complete:

- release layer
- release policy control plane
- release enforcement plane
- crypto authorization core
- crypto execution admission
- consequence admission
- hosted product flow
- proof surface
- production runtime hardening
- service/API boundary refactor

The main remaining engineering gap is the last runtime claim:

```text
local-dev -> memory-backed state is allowed
single-node-durable -> one runtime survives restart with durable file-backed state
production-shared -> multiple runtimes share authoritative release and policy state
```

The repository already proves all three lines in their intended scope. Step 07 proves that one API runtime can cut the request path over to the shared authority-store contract when the PostgreSQL substrate is configured and reachable. Step 08 proves the third line under multi-instance concurrency, restart, reconnect, and recovery pressure using the embedded PostgreSQL harness. Step 09 aligns promotion docs, readiness packets, and anti-overclaim gates so the completed track still stops short of claiming that any external customer-operated environment is automatically production-ready.

The code truth today is clear:

- the runtime profile contract names `production-shared`
- the production profile requires all 8 authority-state components to be `shared`
- the production-shared bootstrap now only reports the async shared-store request-path contract after all 8 shared stores probe successfully and the runtime wires those stores into the actual HTTP request path
- missing, unreachable, or contract-mismatched shared authority stores still keep the request path fail-closed

This tracker closes that gap without muddying the product story.

## Architecture Decision

Start the shared authority plane inside the existing Attestor modular monolith and reuse the repository's existing shared-PostgreSQL patterns.

- authoritative shared record: PostgreSQL
- coordination infrastructure: Redis where already appropriate
- service boundary: still one Attestor service/runtime family
- extraction rule: do not split this into a separate service first; finish the shared authority-plane contract and tests inside the repo before deciding on extraction

The reason is already visible in the codebase:

- `src/service/control-plane-store.ts` already uses a PostgreSQL-backed shared truth model with `pg.Pool`, schema bootstrap, transactions, unique constraints, and `ON CONFLICT` upserts
- the release/policy authority stores now have shared PostgreSQL implementations and an API bootstrap cutover path
- the remaining work is therefore not "invent a distributed platform"; it is "prove the shared authority plane under multi-instance concurrency, restart, reconnect, and operator promotion gates"

The dedicated connection contract for this track is `ATTESTOR_RELEASE_AUTHORITY_PG_URL`.
That env var names the shared PostgreSQL substrate for release and policy authority state; it is separate from `ATTESTOR_CONTROL_PLANE_PG_URL`, `ATTESTOR_BILLING_LEDGER_PG_URL`, and `ATTESTOR_PG_URL`.

## Fresh Research Anchors

Reviewed on 2026-04-24 before opening this track:

- PostgreSQL documents Serializable as the strictest isolation level and notes that applications must be prepared to retry serialization failures, which fits authority-plane mutations that need correctness under concurrency: [PostgreSQL transaction isolation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html)
- PostgreSQL documents `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` as a deterministic statement with explicit arbiter constraints and `RETURNING`, which fits idempotent shared-store upserts for release and policy records: [PostgreSQL INSERT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-insert.html)
- PostgreSQL documents advisory locks as application-defined locks, with transaction-level advisory locks automatically released at transaction end, which fits short-lived coordination around shared authority mutations without inventing a second lock service: [PostgreSQL explicit locking](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html)
- PostgreSQL documents `SKIP LOCKED` as providing an inconsistent view that is suitable for queue-like tables but not for general-purpose state access, which fits reviewer-queue claim paths but not authoritative record reads: [PostgreSQL SELECT locking clause](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html)
- PostgreSQL documents `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` as simple interprocess communication where notifications are delivered between transactions and after commit, which fits cache invalidation or wake-up signals but not durable authority truth by itself: [LISTEN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-listen.html), [NOTIFY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-notify.html)
- PostgreSQL's reliability model is explicitly centered on the Write-Ahead Log, which supports treating shared release/policy authority state as durable database record rather than in-memory coordination state: [PostgreSQL WAL reliability](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal.html)
- Redis documents persistence through RDB and AOF and separately emphasizes backup discipline, which supports keeping Redis as explicit coordination infrastructure rather than silently treating it as the only authority record for release/policy history: [Redis persistence](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence/)
- node-postgres documents that transactions must use the same checked-out client and that most applications should use a connection pool, which matches the repository's existing shared-control-plane PostgreSQL pattern: [node-postgres transactions](https://node-postgres.com/features/transactions), [node-postgres pooling](https://node-postgres.com/features/pooling)
- Kubernetes readiness/liveness/startup probe guidance documents readiness as the signal for whether a container should receive traffic and startup probes as a way to protect slow initialization, which matches the Step 09 decision to make `/api/v1/ready` and promotion probes carry shared-authority truth before traffic is trusted: [Kubernetes probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/)
- PostgreSQL documents connection URIs as first-class libpq connection strings, which matches using `ATTESTOR_RELEASE_AUTHORITY_PG_URL` as the explicit production-shared authority substrate input rather than smearing authority state across file-path knobs: [PostgreSQL libpq connection strings](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html)

## Shared Authority Components

The `production-shared` profile is blocked until all 8 release-authority components are truly shared:

| Component | Current mode | Required mode for `production-shared` |
|---|---|---|
| release decision log | file | shared |
| release reviewer queue | file | shared |
| release token introspection | file | shared |
| release evidence pack store | file | shared |
| release degraded-mode grants | file | shared |
| policy control plane store | file | shared |
| policy activation approval store | file | shared |
| policy mutation audit log | file | shared |

## Progress Summary

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total frozen steps | 9 |
| Completed | 9 |
| In progress | 0 |
| Not started | 0 |
| Current posture | Track complete. The API bootstrap can cut `production-shared` over to the async shared authority-store request path when `ATTESTOR_RELEASE_AUTHORITY_PG_URL` points at reachable PostgreSQL, and `tests/production-shared-multi-instance-recovery.test.ts` proves two API runtimes sharing the same PostgreSQL authority plane under concurrent policy mutations, reviewer-queue claims, token use/revocation, and pool close/reconnect recovery. Runtime bootstrap probes all eight shared authority stores, seeds the finance proving policy into the shared policy store, marks component metadata `bootstrapWired=true` only after the request path is actually wired, and reports `requestPathUsesSharedStores=true` only when all runtime store modes are `shared` and the explicit `async-shared-authority-stores` contract is active. Step 09 now aligns production promotion docs, HA/runtime probes, readiness packets, and anti-overclaim tests with that code truth: the repo proves embedded-PostgreSQL shared authority behavior, while external customer-operated production still requires real environment inputs, probes, and rehearsal. |

## Frozen Step List

| Step | Status | Deliverable | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | complete | Define the production-shared authority-plane scope, cut line, and storage model | `docs/02-architecture/production-shared-authority-plane-buildout.md`, `docs/02-architecture/system-overview.md`, `docs/02-architecture/production-runtime-hardening-buildout.md`, `docs/08-deployment/production-readiness.md`, `README.md`, `tests/production-shared-authority-plane-docs.test.ts`, `package.json` | The next runtime frontier is now frozen as its own tracker. The truth source explicitly keeps one-product framing, keeps `single-node-durable` as the current proven posture, and sets PostgreSQL as the authoritative shared store target for release/policy state while Redis stays in coordination roles. |
| 02 | complete | Add shared release-authority PostgreSQL substrate | `src/service/release-authority-store.ts`, `src/service/bootstrap/release-runtime.ts`, `tests/release-authority-store.test.ts`, `tests/production-runtime-profile.test.ts`, `tests/service-bootstrap-boundary.test.ts`, `tests/production-shared-authority-plane-docs.test.ts`, `package.json`, `docs/02-architecture/production-shared-authority-plane-buildout.md` | A dedicated shared PostgreSQL substrate now exists for release/policy authority state under `ATTESTOR_RELEASE_AUTHORITY_PG_URL`. It bootstraps the `attestor_release_authority` schema, seeds the 8 authority components into a shared registry, exposes pooled transaction and advisory-lock helpers, and gives the release bootstrap an explicit config view of whether the substrate is present. This step does not yet promote the individual release/policy stores off their file-backed implementations. |
| 03 | complete | Add shared release decision log store | `src/service/release-decision-log-store.ts`, `src/release-kernel/release-decision-log.ts`, `tests/release-decision-log-store.test.ts`, `tests/production-shared-authority-plane-docs.test.ts`, `package.json`, `docs/02-architecture/production-shared-authority-plane-buildout.md` | The release decision log now has a PostgreSQL-backed shared store on the release-authority substrate. Appends serialize through transaction-scoped advisory locking, sequence numbers stay contiguous without relying on non-rollback-safe database sequences, the hash chain is re-verified on read, and tampered persisted rows fail closed. The shared store is implemented and registry-marked as ready, while runtime bootstrap wiring still remains for the later production-shared cutover steps. |
| 04 | complete | Add shared release reviewer queue store and claim discipline | `src/service/release-reviewer-queue-store.ts`, `src/release-kernel/reviewer-queue.ts`, `tests/release-reviewer-queue-store.test.ts`, `tests/production-shared-authority-plane-docs.test.ts`, `package.json`, `docs/02-architecture/production-shared-authority-plane-buildout.md` | The reviewer queue now has a PostgreSQL-backed shared store on the release-authority substrate. Durable queue records preserve full reviewer packet JSON, deterministic pending views use direct ordered reads, and multi-consumer claim paths use short `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` transactions with claim leases and token-checked release. This follows PostgreSQL's queue-specific guidance: `SKIP LOCKED` is only used for the claim path, not for authoritative state reads. Runtime bootstrap wiring still remains for the later production-shared cutover steps. |
| 05 | complete | Add shared release token introspection and evidence-pack stores | `src/service/release-token-introspection-store.ts`, `src/service/release-evidence-pack-store.ts`, `tests/release-token-introspection-store.test.ts`, `tests/release-evidence-pack-store.test.ts`, `src/release-layer/index.ts`, `tests/production-shared-authority-plane-docs.test.ts`, `package.json`, `docs/02-architecture/production-shared-authority-plane-buildout.md` | Release token introspection and release evidence packs now have PostgreSQL-backed shared stores on the release-authority substrate. Token use/revocation/lifecycle mutations run under row locks and persist issued, consumed, revoked, expired, and replay state; evidence pack reads and writes verify DSSE signatures and bundle digests and fail closed on tampered persisted rows. The component registry marks both stores ready with `bootstrapWired: false`, preserving the audit truth that runtime cutover remains Step 07. |
| 06 | complete | Add shared degraded-mode and policy-control-plane authority stores | `src/service/release-degraded-mode-grant-store.ts`, `src/service/release-policy-authority-store.ts`, `tests/release-degraded-mode-grant-store.test.ts`, `tests/release-policy-authority-store.test.ts`, `tests/production-shared-authority-plane-docs.test.ts`, `package.json`, `docs/02-architecture/production-shared-authority-plane-buildout.md` | Degraded-mode grants, policy bundle state, activation approvals, and policy mutation audit history now have PostgreSQL-backed shared stores on the release-authority substrate. Degraded-mode grant mutations use transaction-scoped advisory locking and row locks, preserve a tamper-evident audit chain, and fail closed on inconsistent persisted JSON. Policy bundle, activation approval, and mutation audit records persist through shared tables; policy audit appends serialize with contiguous sequence and verified hash linkage. The component registry marks all four stores ready with `bootstrapWired: false`, preserving the audit truth that runtime cutover remains Step 07. |
| 07 | complete | Wire `production-shared` bootstrap, health, and readiness truth | `src/service/release-authority-request-path.ts`, `src/service/bootstrap/release-runtime.ts`, `src/service/bootstrap/shared-authority-readiness.ts`, `src/service/bootstrap/production-shared-request-guard.ts`, `src/service/http/routes/core-routes.ts`, `src/service/http/routes/pipeline-execution-routes.ts`, `src/service/http/routes/pipeline-filing-routes.ts`, `src/service/http/routes/release-review-routes.ts`, `src/service/http/routes/release-policy-control-routes.ts`, `src/service/http/routes/admin-routes.ts`, `src/service/bootstrap/api-route-runtime.ts`, `src/service/bootstrap/routes.ts`, `tests/shared-authority-runtime-readiness.test.ts`, `tests/production-shared-request-guard.test.ts`, `tests/production-shared-preflight-bootstrap.test.ts`, `tests/production-shared-request-path-cutover.test.ts`, `tests/production-runtime-profile.test.ts`, `package.json`, `docs/02-architecture/production-shared-authority-plane-buildout.md` | The production-shared request path now uses awaitable release/policy authority ports and cuts over to PostgreSQL-backed shared stores only after runtime bootstrap probes all eight shared authority components successfully. Shared component metadata is marked `bootstrapWired=true` with `requestPathContract=async-shared-authority-stores` only after bootstrap wiring succeeds. The release/policy HTTP request path now awaits the shared authority-store contract across policy control, pipeline release, filing export verification, reviewer queue, evidence pack, token introspection, degraded-mode grant, and admin release-token/degraded-mode paths. The request-path diagnostic still requires both all-shared runtime store modes and the explicit async contract before `requestPathUsesSharedStores=true`; missing shared store configuration, unreachable PostgreSQL, contract mismatch, and guard blockers remain fail-closed. |
| 08 | complete | Add multi-instance concurrency, restart, and recovery tests | `src/service/release-authority-store.ts`, `tests/production-shared-multi-instance-recovery.test.ts`, `package.json`, `docs/02-architecture/production-shared-authority-plane-buildout.md` | The shared authority plane is now covered by an embedded PostgreSQL multi-instance recovery test. The test creates two API runtimes on the same `ATTESTOR_RELEASE_AUTHORITY_PG_URL`, verifies both report the `async-shared-authority-stores` request-path contract with no blockers, mutates policy packs concurrently through HTTP routes, verifies shared policy audit integrity, exercises `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` reviewer-queue claims with no duplicate claim, consumes a single-use release token once under concurrent use, revokes a token issued by another runtime through the admin API, closes the shared PostgreSQL pool, reconnects a new runtime, and verifies policy, queue-claim, consumed-token, and revoked-token state remain visible. This proves the shared authority plane under repository-embedded PostgreSQL pressure; Step 09 still has to align production promotion/readiness docs without overclaiming external customer-operated rollout. |
| 09 | complete | Update promotion docs, readiness packets, and anti-overclaim gates | `docs/08-deployment/production-readiness.md`, `docs/02-architecture/system-overview.md`, `ops/kubernetes/ha/configmap.yaml`, `ops/kubernetes/ha/api-deployment.yaml`, `ops/kubernetes/ha/worker-deployment.yaml`, `ops/kubernetes/ha/providers/external-secrets/runtime-secrets.yaml`, `scripts/probe/probe-ha-runtime-connectivity.ts`, `scripts/probe/probe-ha-release-inputs.ts`, `scripts/render-ha-credentials.ts`, `scripts/render-ha-promotion-packet.ts`, `scripts/render-production-readiness-packet.ts`, `scripts/render-secret-manager-bootstrap.ts`, `tests/ha-credentials-render.test.ts`, `tests/ha-runtime-connectivity-probe.test.ts`, `tests/ha-release-bundle-render.test.ts`, `tests/ha-release-input-probe.test.ts`, `tests/ha-promotion-packet.test.ts`, `tests/kubernetes-ha-bundle.test.ts`, `tests/production-readiness-packet.test.ts`, `tests/production-runtime-profile.test.ts`, `tests/production-shared-authority-plane-docs.test.ts`, `tests/secret-manager-bootstrap-render.test.ts`, `package.json` | The promotion/readiness chain now treats `ATTESTOR_RUNTIME_PROFILE` as an explicit production input and requires `ATTESTOR_RELEASE_AUTHORITY_PG_URL` for `production-shared`. HA connectivity probes include release-authority PostgreSQL reachability, HA release probes and promotion packets block without it, the Kubernetes/secret render path carries the release-authority PostgreSQL input, and the combined production-readiness packet has a runtime-authority section plus anti-overclaim language. The docs now state that the repo proves embedded-PostgreSQL shared authority behavior, while external customer-operated production remains gated on real environment packets and rehearsal. |

Follow-up guard note: the shared authority request-path cutover is no longer
sufficient by itself to open non-preflight `production-shared` API routes. The
HTTP guard also requires `consequenceSharedStoreProfile.readyForSelectedProfile=true`,
so consequence shared-store blockers remain fail-closed even when release/policy
authority stores are PostgreSQL-backed.

## Immediate Next Step

This frozen track is complete. The next production step is not a new internal shared-authority feature; it is running the production-readiness packet and rehearsal against a real target environment, then opening a new tracker only for gaps proven by that environment.
