# Signing and Verification

Attestor uses Ed25519 asymmetric signing for portable attestation certificates and reviewer endorsements. This is the same signing primitive used by Sigstore, SLSA, and SSH.

## Portable Attestation Certificates

Certificates are JSON documents that bind the full authority chain, evidence anchors, governance results, and live proof into a single cryptographically signed artifact.

**What a certificate proves:**

- **WHO** signed (Ed25519 public key identity + fingerprint)
- **WHAT** was decided (pass/fail/block with decision summary)
- **HOW** it was governed (SQL governance, policy, guardrails, data contracts, scorers)
- **WHAT** evidence exists (evidence chain root/terminal, audit chain integrity, SQL hash, snapshot hash)
- **WHETHER** execution was live or fixture-based (live proof mode + consistency)

**Verification is portable and offline — no platform access, no database, no API call. The default verifier path is PKI-first: kit verification requires trust chain material (CA → leaf → certificate binding) and a trusted CA fingerprint pinned out of band. When chain material is absent, the CLI exits with code 2 (`PKI_REQUIRED`). When a kit provides a CA but no trusted CA fingerprint is supplied, the CLI exits with code 2 (`TRUST_ROOT_REQUIRED`) unless the caller explicitly chooses developer mode. Legacy flat Ed25519 verification (certificate JSON + signer public key only) remains available as an explicit override (`--allow-legacy-verify` or `ATTESTOR_ALLOW_LEGACY=true`).**

For independent third-party trust, the verifier must pin the expected CA fingerprint out-of-band with `--trusted-ca-fingerprint` or `ATTESTOR_TRUSTED_CA_FINGERPRINT`. A kit-contained `caPublicKeyPem` can prove internal chain consistency only when `--developer-mode` is explicitly selected; it is not by itself an out-of-band trust root.

```bash
# Generate a signing key pair
npm run keygen

# Run a product proof (certificate issued automatically)
npm run prove -- counterparty

# Verify a certificate independently
npm run verify:cert -- path/to/certificate.json path/to/public.pem

# Verify a full kit against a pinned CA root
npm run verify:cert -- path/to/kit.json --trusted-ca-fingerprint <ca-fingerprint>

# Local developer chain-integrity check only; not independent third-party trust
npm run verify:cert -- path/to/kit.json --developer-mode
```

## Verification Kit

A product-proof run emits a self-contained verification kit:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `kit.json` | Certificate + authority bundle + reviewer endorsement + verification summary |
| `certificate.json` | Portable Ed25519-signed attestation certificate |
| `bundle.json` | Authority bundle with full governance evidence and replay identity |
| `verification-summary.json` | 6-dimensional verification result |
| `public-key.pem` | Runtime signer public key |
| `reviewer-public.pem` | Reviewer signer public key (when endorsement is signed) |

## PKI Verification

PKI chain verification is now **mandatory** across both CLI and API.

**CLI verify behavior:**
- When PKI chain material is present in a kit: full CA → leaf → certificate binding verification
- When a trusted CA fingerprint is supplied: the CA public key must match that pinned trust root
- When a trusted CA fingerprint is absent: verification fails closed with `TRUST_ROOT_REQUIRED`
- Developer mode (`--developer-mode`) allows kit-contained CA chain-integrity checks for local development only; independent third-party trust is not claimed
- When PKI chain material is absent: **exit code 2** (`PKI_REQUIRED`) — verification impossible
- Legacy flat Ed25519 override: `--allow-legacy-verify` or `ATTESTOR_ALLOW_LEGACY=true`

**API verify behavior (mandatory):**
- `/api/v1/verify` requires `trustChain` + `caPublicKeyPem` alongside `certificate` + `publicKeyPem`
- `/api/v1/verify` also requires `trustedCaFingerprint` for independent PKI verification
- When trust chain is provided: full PKI verification with chain integrity, issuer linkage, certificate-to-leaf binding, expiry, and revocation inputs where supplied
- If certificate signature verification succeeds but PKI binding fails, the response `overall` is `invalid`
- When trust chain is absent: **422 rejection** with error message and hint
- When the trusted CA fingerprint is absent: **422 rejection** with error message and hint
- Legacy flat Ed25519 override: `ATTESTOR_ALLOW_LEGACY_API=true` (deprecated, will be removed)
- Returns `verificationMode` (`'pki'` or `'legacy_ed25519'`), `chainVerification`, and `trustBinding`

**API issuance:**
- `POST /api/v1/pipeline/run` with `sign=true` returns keyless-first signed certificate + trust chain + CA public key
- `VerificationKit` now self-contains `trustChain` and `caPublicKeyPem` — no separate files needed
- Every signed run uses per-request ephemeral keys with CA-issued short-lived certs

**Current boundary:**
- CLI: PKI chain and trusted CA pin mandatory for third-party verification (exit code 2 without chain or pin; `--developer-mode` is local chain-integrity only)
- API: PKI chain and trusted CA pin mandatory for PKI verification (422 without chain or pin; `ATTESTOR_ALLOW_LEGACY_API=true` legacy escape remains deprecated)
- `verifyCertificate()` low-level primitive remains flat Ed25519 (intentional — cryptographic primitive, no PKI awareness)
- All public verification surfaces (CLI, API, kit) require PKI chain material and an out-of-band trust root by default

## 6-Dimensional Verification

The verify CLI checks six dimensions:

1. **Cryptographic**: Ed25519 signature validity and fingerprint consistency
2. **Structural**: certificate schema version and type
3. **Authority**: warrant fulfilled, escrow released, receipt issued
4. **Governance sufficiency**: SQL governance, policy, guardrails passed
5. **Proof completeness**: proof mode, execution liveness, gap count
6. **Reviewer endorsement**: present, signed, run-bound, binding-checked, verified

## Reviewer Endorsement

Reviewer endorsements are Ed25519-signed statements by the human reviewer who approved the run.

**What a reviewer endorsement proves:**

- **WHO** approved (reviewer name, role, identifier, Ed25519 fingerprint)
- **WHAT** they approved (the decision they saw)
- **WHEN** they approved (endorsement timestamp)
- **WHY** they approved (rationale)
- **WHICH RUN** they approved (run-bound: runId + replayIdentity + evidenceChainTerminal)

### Run Binding

The endorsement signature covers the specific `runId`, `replayIdentity`, and `evidenceChainTerminal`. This prevents cross-run replay: a valid endorsement from one run cannot be injected into a different run's verification kit.

The verification summary checks binding equality:

- `endorsement.runBinding.runId` must equal `bundle.runId`
- `endorsement.runBinding.evidenceChainTerminal` must equal `bundle.evidence.chainTerminal`
- `endorsement.runBinding.replayIdentity` must equal `bundle.evidence.replayIdentity`

If any field mismatches, the summary reports `bindingMismatch = true` and `verified = false`.

### Reviewer Key Material

```bash
# Default: ephemeral reviewer key for local proof demonstration
npm run prove -- counterparty

# Persistent reviewer key directory
npm run prove -- counterparty .attestor --reviewer-key-dir ./reviewer-keys

# Expected files: reviewer-private.pem + reviewer-public.pem
```

When reviewer key material is absent, the kit stays truthful: `reviewerEndorsement.verified = false`. The verify CLI output explains why.

## Trust Chain

```text
Generator (AI) → Governor (Attestor runtime) → Reviewer (human, Ed25519-signed) → Certificate
```

The runtime certificate signer and the reviewer endorsement signer use **separate key pairs**. This preserves separation of authority: the system signs the overall attestation, the reviewer signs their specific approval.
