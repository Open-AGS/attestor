# First Hosted API Call

This quickstart shows the first customer-owned API call after hosted signup.

Part of: [How to integrate Attestor](how-to-integrate-attestor.md)

Use it when you already have a hosted account and the one-time plaintext `initialKey.apiKey` returned by `POST /api/v1/auth/signup`.

It does not replace the canonical route contract in [Hosted journey contract](hosted-journey-contract.md), and it does not define pricing. Pricing lives in [Commercial packaging, pricing, and evaluation](product-packaging.md).

For the cross-pack operating model and canonical decision vocabulary, use [Operating model](operating-model.md).

For wrapping the domain-native finance response into the shared `admit` / `narrow` / `review` / `block` shape, use [Consequence admission quickstart](consequence-admission-quickstart.md).
For the customer-side enforcement helper, use [Customer admission gate](customer-admission-gate.md).

## What You Are Proving

Your system is not handing control to Attestor. It is adding a gate before consequence:

1. your system prepares a proposed output, query, action, or other consequence material
2. your system calls Attestor with a tenant API key
3. Attestor returns a decision, proof posture, tenant context, and usage state
4. your system only writes, sends, files, executes, or settles if the decision allows it

Choose the hosted path that matches the consequence you need to control. Do not
rely on payload shape to select the domain for you.

## 1. Configure The Client

Use the tenant API key in the HTTP `Authorization` header.

```bash
export ATTESTOR_BASE_URL="https://<your-attestor-host>"
export ATTESTOR_API_KEY="<initialKey.apiKey>"
```

Keep the key in a secret store or environment variable. Do not put it in URLs, client-side code, tickets, screenshots, or logs. Historical API-key list responses do not expose plaintext secret material again.

## 2. Confirm The Account Context

Call `GET /api/v1/account/usage` before the first consequence call:

```bash
curl -sS "$ATTESTOR_BASE_URL/api/v1/account/usage" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ATTESTOR_API_KEY"
```

Expected shape:

```json
{
  "tenantContext": {
    "source": "api_key",
    "planId": "trial"
  },
  "usage": {
    "used": 0,
    "quota": 10000,
    "remaining": 10000,
    "enforced": true,
    "hardLimit": true,
    "overage": false,
    "overageUnits": 0
  }
}
```

Exact IDs and limits depend on the account and plan. The important signal is that the tenant context, usage, quota, overage, and enforcement posture are visible before the first consequence call.

## 3. Call Attestor Before Consequence

This reference payload uses the finance proof wedge because it is the deepest proven path today. Production callers should send their own proposed consequence material and evidence source.

Call `POST /api/v1/pipeline/run` from the customer system that is about to write, send, file, execute, or settle. Use a unique `Idempotency-Key` per proposed action:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$ATTESTOR_BASE_URL/api/v1/pipeline/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ATTESTOR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: $ATTESTOR_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY" \

JSON

Expected shape:

```json
{
  "decision": "pass",
  "proofMode": "offline_fixture",
  "tenantContext": {
    "source": "api_key",
    "planId": "trial"
  },
  "usage": {
    "used": 1,
    "remaining": 9999,
    "overage": false,
    "overageUnits": 0
  }
}
```

This is the shipped finance route's domain-native finance decision. In the canonical admission vocabulary, `pass` is the finance allow branch and maps to canonical `admit`. The typed finance projection in `src/consequence-admission/finance.ts` now performs that mapping for the current hosted finance response without changing this route shape.

The downstream system should gate on the returned decision. If the decision is not allowed for the consequence, do not write, send, file, execute, or settle.

## 4. Project To Admission And Enforce The Gate

The hosted finance route returns its domain-native response. Before a customer system runs the downstream action, project that response into the shared admission shape and enforce the customer gate:

```ts
import {
  assertConsequenceAdmissionGateAllows,
  createConsequenceAdmissionFacadeResponse,
} from 'attestor/consequence-admission';

const admission = createConsequenceAdmissionFacadeResponse({
  surface: 'finance-pipeline-run',
  run,
  decidedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  requestInput: {
    actorRef: 'actor:hosted-finance-workflow',
    authorityMode: 'tenant-api-key',
    summary: 'Hosted finance workflow asks whether the reporting consequence may proceed.',
  },
});

assertConsequenceAdmissionGateAllows({
  admission,
  downstreamAction: 'customer_reporting_store.write',
});

// Only now may the customer system write, send, file, execute, or route onward.
```

By default, the customer gate requires proof for `admit` and `narrow` decisions. Keep that default for first integrations unless you are deliberately testing a non-consequential local path.

## 5. Optional Signed Proof

The first hosted call above sets `sign` to `true` so the response can include `certificate`, `publicKeyPem`, `trustChain`, and `caPublicKeyPem`.

Verify that material with:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$ATTESTOR_BASE_URL/api/v1/verify" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ATTESTOR_API_KEY" \
  --data-binary @verify-payload.json
```

The verify payload is built from the signed pipeline response and must include a `trustedCaFingerprint` pinned from an out-of-band trusted source. A valid verification response includes `overall`, `signatureValid`, and trust-binding fields.

## Failure Signals

- `401`: the tenant API key is missing, invalid, or revoked
- `400`: the request shape is invalid, usually missing `candidateSql` or `intent`
- `429`: free/trial hard quota or rate limit blocks the run; the rejected run does not become a downstream consequence
- paid workflow overage: Starter Workflow and Pro Workflow continue returning `200`, keep `remaining` at `0`, mark workflow usage overage plus overage units, and include Stripe workflow meter-event status for that over-quota run
- non-allowed decision: the downstream system must fail closed or route to review
