# Consequence Admission Buildout Tracker

This tracker covers the Attestor consequence-admission contract: the customer-facing operating model and typed decision facade that make the existing platform core easier to integrate.

The goal is not to add a second product, a crypto-only track, or another broad surface. The goal is to turn the existing Attestor platform into a simpler first integration path:

**proposed consequence -> Attestor admission decision -> proof -> downstream consequence only if allowed**

## Guardrails For This Tracker

- The numbered step list below is frozen for this buildout track.
- Step ids and titles do not get rewritten or renumbered later.
- We may append clarifying notes, acceptance criteria, or sub-notes.
- We may only change the `Status`, `Evidence`, and `Notes` columns as work progresses.
- Keep Attestor as one product with one platform core and modular packs.
- Treat finance and crypto as pack families on the same consequence-admission model.
- Do not claim a public hosted crypto HTTP route until a route contract, implementation, tests, and tracker step exist.
- The generic hosted admission route is `POST /api/v1/admissions`; do not claim the old placeholder `POST /api/v1/admit`.
- Do not make Attestor sound like a magical router that guesses packs automatically.
- Keep the public decision vocabulary bounded: `admit`, `narrow`, `review`, `block`.

## Why This Track Exists

The repo already has serious shipped surfaces:

- finance hosted proof wedge through `POST /api/v1/pipeline/run`
- signed proof verification through `POST /api/v1/verify`
- release-layer, policy-control-plane, and enforcement-plane package surfaces
- crypto authorization and execution-admission package surfaces
- local proof surface through `npm run proof:surface`

The remaining problem is the first integration mental model.

External users should not need to learn every internal domain decision before they understand the basic rule:

**Attestor returns whether a proposed consequence may proceed, with proof.**

## Frozen Step List

| Step | Status | Deliverable | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | complete | Codify the operating model and canonical admission vocabulary | `docs/01-overview/operating-model.md`, `docs/02-architecture/consequence-admission-buildout.md`, `tests/consequence-admission-operating-model.test.ts`, `README.md`, `docs/01-overview/purpose.md`, `docs/02-architecture/system-overview.md`, `docs/01-overview/hosted-first-api-call.md`, `docs/01-overview/finance-and-crypto-first-integrations.md`, `package.json` | Attestor now has a customer-facing truth source for proposed consequence -> explicit path -> policy/authority/evidence/freshness/enforcement checks -> canonical decision -> proof -> downstream enforcement. The docs explicitly map finance `pass` to canonical `admit`, crypto `needs-evidence` to `review`, and crypto `deny` to `block`, while blocking public hosted crypto route and universal admission route overclaims. |
| 02 | complete | Add the typed canonical admission contract | `src/consequence-admission/index.ts`, `tests/consequence-admission-contract.test.ts`, `package.json`, `docs/02-architecture/consequence-admission-buildout.md` | The canonical contract now defines versioned request/response types, pack families, explicit entry points, proposed consequence shape, policy/authority/evidence inputs, policy/authority/evidence/freshness/enforcement/adapter-readiness checks, `admit` / `narrow` / `review` / `block` decisions, proof refs, fail-closed problem details, canonical digests, and native mapping helpers for finance pipeline decisions and crypto execution-admission outcomes. Unknown native values fail closed, `narrow` requires explicit constraints, and `review` / `block` default to fail-closed posture. |
| 03 | complete | Add finance decision mapping into the admission contract | `src/consequence-admission/finance.ts`, `src/consequence-admission/index.ts`, `tests/consequence-admission-finance.test.ts`, `docs/01-overview/operating-model.md`, `docs/01-overview/hosted-first-api-call.md`, `docs/01-overview/finance-and-crypto-first-integrations.md`, `package.json` | The finance adapter wraps the current hosted finance pipeline response into a canonical admission request/response without changing route behavior. It maps native pipeline `pass` to `admit`, accepted filing release status to `admit`, held/review-required status to fail-closed `review`, denied/expired/revoked/unknown paths to fail-closed `block`, and emits policy/authority/evidence/freshness/enforcement/adapter-readiness checks plus certificate, verification-kit, release-token, release-evidence-pack, and review-queue proof references when present. |
| 04 | complete | Add crypto package outcome mapping into the admission contract | `src/consequence-admission/crypto.ts`, `src/consequence-admission/index.ts`, `tests/consequence-admission-crypto.test.ts`, `docs/01-overview/operating-model.md`, `docs/01-overview/finance-and-crypto-first-integrations.md`, `package.json` | The crypto adapter wraps `CryptoExecutionAdmissionPlan` into canonical admission request/response objects through a package-boundary entry point. Package-native `admit` maps to canonical `admit`, `needs-evidence` maps to fail-closed `review`, and `deny` maps to fail-closed `block`. The adapter emits policy/authority/evidence/freshness/enforcement/adapter-readiness checks plus admission-plan, simulation, and source-module proof references while explicitly keeping `route: null` for crypto. |
| 05 | complete | Add the first customer-facing admission facade | `src/consequence-admission/facade.ts`, `src/consequence-admission/index.ts`, `tests/consequence-admission-facade.test.ts`, `scripts/probe/probe-consequence-admission-package-surface.mjs`, `package.json`, `docs/01-overview/operating-model.md`, `docs/01-overview/finance-and-crypto-first-integrations.md`, `tests/consequence-admission-operating-model.test.ts` | The first public facade is exported through `attestor/consequence-admission`. It requires an explicit `finance-pipeline-run` or `crypto-execution-plan` surface, delegates to the tested finance and crypto projections, preserves `/api/v1/pipeline/run` as the finance hosted route, preserves `attestor/crypto-execution-admission` as the crypto package boundary, rejects automatic pack detection, and keeps `publicHostedCryptoRouteClaimed: false`. |
| 06 | complete | Add admission readiness and quickstart gates | `docs/01-overview/consequence-admission-quickstart.md`, `tests/consequence-admission-readiness.test.ts`, `tests/consequence-admission-operating-model.test.ts`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `docs/01-overview/operating-model.md`, `docs/01-overview/hosted-first-api-call.md`, `docs/01-overview/finance-and-crypto-first-integrations.md`, `docs/02-architecture/system-overview.md`, `docs/02-architecture/consequence-admission-buildout.md` | The quickstart documents how to use `attestor/consequence-admission`, preserves finance as `POST /api/v1/pipeline/run`, preserves crypto as `attestor/crypto-execution-admission` with `route: null`, and names the readiness/package/full verify gates. The readiness test proves README, operating model, first-call docs, first-integration docs, tracker posture, package export, facade descriptor, finance route descriptor, crypto package descriptor, native mapping helpers, and fail-fast explicit-surface behavior stay aligned. |

## Extension After The Frozen Track

The first post-track extension is the generic hosted admission route:

```text
POST /api/v1/admissions
```

This route accepts an explicit consequence domain and an explicit adoption mode:

```text
observe -> warn -> review -> enforce
```

The design follows the same safety posture as established admission systems: non-enforcing modes can show what policy would have done before a team turns on enforcement; enforcing modes hold or block incomplete consequences before downstream execution. The route is not automatic pack detection and does not replace the finance or crypto package boundaries.

Evidence:

- `src/consequence-admission/index.ts`
- `src/service/http/routes/generic-admission-routes.ts`
- `tests/generic-admission-mode-ladder.test.ts`
- `tests/generic-admission-routes.test.ts`
- `docs/01-overview/consequence-admission-quickstart.md`
- `docs/01-overview/operating-model.md`

## Immediate Next Step

Continue the action-authorization roadmap with shadow event recording and policy discovery. The generic route should remain explicit and small until the recorder, summaries, and simulation reports exist.
